A-Innovation

Project Idea

My project is a chatbot for students specifically arriving in Paris. The idea came to me because it’s something I wish I had when I arrived to Paris 2 years ago. 

Features:

•	Helps students with administrative questions (CAF, OFII, Navigo, housing, insurance…)
•	Multilingual chatbot for international students
•	Personalized answers depending on your background (EU vs non-EU, minor vs adult, French speaking vs non-French speaking)
•	 Generates a checklist for you

Why this idea is innovative:

At first glance, supporting students with administrative tasks may sound common. However, the innovation lies in the specificity of the target audience and the personalization:

•	Existing resources often give general advice, are static and overwhelming
•	There is no chatbot designed for students arriving in Paris that is this personalized and multilingual
•	This tool directly addresses the pain points of international students: missing deadlines, lack of guidance, and navigating confusing procedures

This chatbot will ease integration and adaptation in the city of Paris by offering tailored, step-by-step help that currently does not exist.

Competitor Research:

•	Welcome2France (Gov site): Official French platform for newcomers (housing, admin, visas)  Static website, no interactivity, no personalization.

•	Campus France: Info hub for international students  Focused on study application, limited ongoing admin support.

•	Studapart / Lokaviz: Student housing platforms  Only housing related ot general admin

•	Generic AI chatbots: Can answer questions on admin topics if prompted Not localized, no built-in checklist or case-specific personalization

Conclusion and Grading Category:

After researching existing resources, it is clear that while general information platforms exist, none of them provide a dedicated chatbot with:

•	Multilingual support
•	Personalized checklists
•	Tailored administrative guidance for Paris newcomers

For this reason, I consider my project to fall into the Innovative category.
